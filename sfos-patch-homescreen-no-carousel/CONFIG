Maintainer: ichthyosaurus
Summary: Disables the homescreen carousel
Description:
- Disables the carousel on the homescreen by removing the left side of the events-view
- and the right side of the switcher-view. This allows closing apps by swiping the
- cover to the left in the switcher-view.
-
- Notifications now can be dismissed by swiping them to the right without having to press
- the "housekeeping" button introduced in SFOS 4. Swiping the header dismisses all
- notifications.
-
- This is an updated version of [cornerman's patch](https://openrepos.net/content/cornerman/patch-no-home-carousel),
- which was updated by [kuba7](https://coderus.openrepos.net/pm2/project/no-home-carousel)
- and [miau](https://coderus.openrepos.net/pm2/project/sailfishos-no-home-carousel-fork) for
- SFOS 4 but was missing support for swiping away notifications.
- Description adapted from kuba7's patch.

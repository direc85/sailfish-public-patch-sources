Summary: Makes the keyboard height and position configurable
Description:
- This patch allows to configure the height of keyboard rows, and the vertical
- position of the whole keyboard.
-
- Using the keyboard on phones with a “long” display like the Xperia 10
- can be quite uncomfortable. This patch allows you to move the entire keyboard
- higher up on the screen to make it easier accessible without having to lose grip.
-
- On the other hand, phones like the Xperia X with smaller displays can benefit
- from a smaller keyboard, so you can see more of the screen while typing.
-
- This patch replaces three of my other patches:
- [keyboard for “long” phones](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-keyboard-adapted-long-phones-xperia-10) like Xperia 10,
- [smaller keyboard](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-smaller-keyboard), and
- [higher keyboard rows](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-higher-keyboard-rows).
-
- If you installed one of them through the Patchmanager Web Catalog, please remove
- it manually before applying this new patch.
-
- After installing the patch, you can select a preset from the pull-down menu
- or apply custom values.

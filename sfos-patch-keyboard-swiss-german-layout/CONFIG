Summary: Patch adding a new Swiss German keyboard layout
Description:
- This patch adds a new Swiss German keyboard layout.
-
- Many special characters are available if you long-press a key.
-
- The new layout includes an extra row of keys. Therefore I recommend installing
- the [smaller keyboard patch](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-smaller-keyboard)
- which reduces the default height of the keyboard so it does not take as much
- space on the screen.
-
- Note: the keyboard has a special key on the symbols page for switching to the
- emoji keyboard. This key only works if the emoji keyboard is enabled in the
- system settings. You can use [color emoji patch](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-stock-emoji-keyboard-colors)
- to be able to use all emojis with skin tone variations, etc.

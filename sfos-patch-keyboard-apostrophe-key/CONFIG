Summary: Patch adding an apostrophe key next to the comma key in the space bar row.
Description:
- Patch adding an apostrophe key next to the comma key in the space bar row.
-
- Please note that this patch only works with the stock keyboard. It does however
- work with patches adding custom keyboard layouts. Not supported is, for
- example, the Dolphin keyboard.
-
- Note: this patch conflicts with the
- [patch adding accents to spacebar row keys](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-overloaded-spacebar-row-keys).
- Therefore I added the same characters here, too.

Summary: [obsolete] Keyboard adapted to “long” phones (like Xperia 10)
Description:
- **This patch has been replaced by the new [configurable keyboard height](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-configurable-keyboard-height) patch.**
-
- Using the keyboard on phones with a “long” form factor like the Xperia 10
- can be quite uncomfortable. This patch moves the entire keyboard higher up
- on the screen to make it easier accessible without having to lose grip.
-

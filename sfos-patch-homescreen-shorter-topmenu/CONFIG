Maintainer: ichthyosaurus
Summary: Reduce topmenu height for smaller screens
Description:
- This patch allows to shave off a configurable amount of pixels from the top
- menu to make it fit into the screen without scrolling.
-
- On devices with smaller screens, it can easily happen that the topmenu in
- your current configuration is slightly longer than the screen.
-
- If that happens, you have to swipe twice to close it: once for scrolling to
- the bottom, once for closing. This can get annoying and is solved by the patch.

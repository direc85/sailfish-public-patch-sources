Summary: Patch adding a new Georgian keyboard layout
Description:
- This patch adds a new Georgian (Mchedruli) keyboard layout.
-
- A full Latin layout is availble on the second and third keyboard pages to
- allow mixing Georgian and Latin scripts more quickly. Many special characters
- are available if you long-press a key.
-
- The new layout includes an extra row of keys. Therefore I recommend installing
- the [smaller keyboard patch](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-smaller-keyboard)
- which reduces the default height of the keyboard so it does not take as much
- space on the screen.
-
- Note: the keyboard has a special key on the symbols page for switching to the
- emoji keyboard. You can use the [color emoji patch](https://openrepos.net/content/ichthyosaurus/patch-stock-emoji-keyboard-colors)
- to be able to use all emojis with skin tone variations, etc. If no emoji
- keyboard is enabled, the key lets you quickly switch between the current and
- the last used character keyboard.
-
- Credits: the keyboard layout was originally written by [gamag](https://openrepos.net/users/gamag)
- and gets occasionally updates from [ichthyosaurus](https://openrepos.net/users/ichthyosaurus).

Maintainer: ichthyosaurus
Summary: Extra keyboard button to toggle text prediction
Description:
- This patch adds a toggle button left of the clipboard.
-
- Clicking the button enables or disables text prediction. The default state is
- restored when the keyboard is closed. It can also be reset manually
- by pressing and holding the switch, just as you would clear the clipboard.
-
- While developing the patch, it often caused the keyboard to freeze. This should
- no longer happen, but if it does, removing the patch should suffice.
-
-
- Some useful commands for developing keyboard patches:
-
- - remove the patch: /usr/sbin/patchmanager -u sfos-patch-keyboard-toggle-prediction
- - restart the keyboard: systemctl --user restart maliit-server
- - reset settings: dconf reset /patch/ichthyosaurus/keyboard-toggle-prediction/enabled

Maintainer: ichthyosaurus
Summary: Reduce the time needed until the settings app becomes responsive
Description:
- This patch reduces the startup time of the settings app, which is painfully
- slow without the patch.
-
- The lag is not actually fixed but rather delayed and split up. This doesn't
- make the app more beautiful but it makes it much less annoying to open it.
-
- This patch is one in a series of patches that make it more bearable that I
- have to restart the network all the time since SFOS 4.x. Without the patch,
- I had to wait up to ten seconds until I could push the "restart network" button
- on the utilities settings page. With the patch and a shortcut in the top menu,
- the page becomes interactive almost immediately.
